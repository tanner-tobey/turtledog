//! # The BlueBird Memory Allocator
//!
//! This module will be responsible for defining the global allocator
//! for all BlueBird programs. Using a custom allocator like jemalloc
//! can provide significant performance benefits in multi-threaded applications.
//!
//! For now, this is a placeholder that would be expanded upon.

// Example of how you would set a global allocator.
// use jemallocator::Jemalloc;
//
// #[global_allocator]
// static GLOBAL: Jemalloc = Jemalloc;

/// Represents a BlueBird `list` object in the runtime.
/// It contains a pointer to the heap, the length, and the capacity.
#[repr(C)]
pub struct BluebirdList<T> {
    ptr: *mut T,
    len: usize,
    capacity: usize,
}

// Implementations for list creation, push, pop, etc., would go here.
// These functions would be called by the compiled BlueBird code.
